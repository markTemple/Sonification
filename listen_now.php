<h2>Sonification examples</h2>
	
<p>The Sonification tools on this site are dynamic, that is they run in real time to generate the audio output, directly from the DNA sequence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools for DNA sequence analysis and/or random music generation, a bunch of sequences have been run prior and can be listened to on these example pages. All audio was created directly from the sonification tool with no further processing. Whilst the tools creates MIDI output data, these pre-run files have been converted to mp3 files so that they can be played in most web browsers without the need for additional plugins. However, mp3 files are much larger that the original MIDI files, please bare this in mind whilst streaming these files.
